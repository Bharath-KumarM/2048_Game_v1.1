# 2048_Game_v1.1

2048 Gameüî• is a simple sliding tile game. The game is played by sliding tiles in either of the four directions. The goal of the game is to slide the tiles to combine numbers to form 2048.

## Game Play

2048 Gameüî• can be played on 3X3, 4X4, 5X5, 6X6, 7X7, 8X8, 9X9 and 10X10 grids. The most commonly played size of the grid is 4X4. The grid size can be changed under the Change Grid‚öôÔ∏è option. The grid with numbered tiles is moved by the user either by clicking arrow keys or swiping (if played on touch screen devices). Every turn a random tile appears (aka spawn tile) with a numeric value of 2 or 4 in a random position in the grid. The slide of tiles reaches the most edge of the grid based on the user's swiped direction, the tiles don't overlap while sliding but combine and double the value of the combined tile if the numeric values are the same. If the numeric values are not the same tiles stack one after another without a gap.

The aim is to swipe tiles, so the tiles combine, values get doubled and the grid has enough space for a new tile to spawn for each move. The game is over if the grid has no room to spawn a tile.
