# 2048_Game_v1.2

2048 Gameüî• is a simple sliding tile game. The game is played by sliding tiles in either of the four directions. The goal of the game is to slide the tiles to combine numbers to form 2048.

## Game Play

2048 Gameüî• can be played on 3X3, 4X4, 5X5, 6X6, 7X7, 8X8, 9X9 and 10X10 grids. The most commonly played size is 4X4. The grid size can be changed under the Change Grid‚öôÔ∏è option. The grid with numbered tiles is moved by the user either by clicking arrow keys or swiping (if played on touch screen devices). Every turn a random tile appears with a numeric value of 2 or 4 in a random position in the grid. The sliding of tiles can combine two tiles in the same sliding direction with the same number and become one tile with dobuled value.

The aim is to swipe logically so the tiles combine, values get doubled and the grid has enough space for a new tile to spawn for each move. The game is over if the grid has no room to spawn a tile or you reach 2048 tile value.
